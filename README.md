### About [Elmer](https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer)

Elmer is an open-source multiphysical simulation software mainly
developed by CSC - IT Center for Science (CSC).  Elmer includes
physical models of fluid dynamics, structural mechanics,
electromagnetics, heat transfer and acoustics, etc. These are
described by partial differential equations, which Elmer solves by the
Finite Element Method (FEM).
